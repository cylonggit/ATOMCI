1. These two projects are client SDKS for Fabric 2.2.2. We've made some changes to the official SDK to make it easier to use. These SDKS will be used by AtomCITest (either by Maven or directly using the JAR package )

2. Use: ``` mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true ``` to build the projects.

3. First install the project fabric-sdk-java-2.2.2. Then install the project fabric-gateway-java-2.2.2.
